In this repository there are some parts of the Unity videogame that I'm developing for Android.
If you want to receive an .apk of the videogame, write me an email.

## Project's Idea
My main idea was to create a 3D Runner game as my first videogame, where you control a Car on a road.
The rules are pretty basic, the Car always go forward and you can move right and left just by tapping the right or left side of the screen. There are some obstacles on the road, and if you hit them you crash the car and lose the run. The objective of the game is to go as far as possible, and you can even pick up coins to buy new models of the car.

## Current status of the game
The game actually is completed at 60%, main parts are almost done. I need to work mostly on graphic parts, music, and power ups but those are heavy to devolop standole

## Scripts
The most important part of the repository is the Scripts one. The folder contains every C# file that does something useful into the game, like for example the controller of the player's movement (or even the bots movement).
If you want to know more deeply what a script do, see [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html) for the Unity documentation.

## Animations
The animations simply move the body of some objects (not necessary the collider), so they can be super useful for example when the car moves between the lanes
